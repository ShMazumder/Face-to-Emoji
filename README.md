# Real time emotion recognition and emotion to emoticon

The NN part of this repo is the same as the one here: https://github.com/reach2ashish/emote

For more insight on the opencv part check out my previous repo- meme_generator
Will be adding better face detection classifiers soon

Download the trained model from the links given in source/trained-model.txt and place them in the same folder

## Run
```
python3 nnModel.py
```

## Explaination
Is given in the code as comments. Do give them a read.

## Sample output
